<p class='c003'>Letters of condolence and of cynicism come to my desk in
these latter days in increasing number. There is a note of triumph
and of mockery in one group: “What has become of the famous
Peace idea? The South African war, following immediately
upon the close of the Peace Conference at The Hague, has not yet
reached its end, and already the horizon in Eastern Asia is
lurid with the glare of a world-war. Are you convinced now of
the absurdity of your claims, ye dreamers of peace?” Through
the second group runs an undertone of commiseration: “What
suffering must have come to you, honored madame, and to your
friends, in seeing your beautiful illusion shattered. Sad, sad;
but thus it is. War is an historic law, and your ideals are simply—ideals.
You will have to reef your sails in the face of such a
storm of facts.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It is true that a feebly manned boat cannot battle against storm
and surf. But the simile ill fits the effort to establish peace.
That is no boat; it is a rock. The waves may top it with their
wrathful spume, but naught can affect its granite permanence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let me set aside metaphor and reply to my correspondents.
Let me endeavor to show them the point of view from which the
advocates of peace regard the present condition of the world, and
the nature of the duties and prospects, the hopes and self-denials
to be descried therefrom.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the first place, we admit candidly that we have been mistaken;
not, however, in the principles we have enunciated, but
in our estimate of present culture. We had regarded public conscience
as being permeated by a longing for international right
and by an abhorrence of despotism to a greater degree than the
facts of the case warrant.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>The warlike events that surge about us and threaten us furnish
no proof against the principles of the peace movement. They
merely prove that these principles have not yet entered fully into
the conscience of nations and of their leaders; that the movement
is not yet sufficiently advanced in its spread, its organization, its
methods of action, to verify the hopes fostered by the conference
at The Hague for an early eradication of old, deeply-rooted institutions
of brute force. In other words, we have been mistaken,
not in the fundamental statements we have made, but in the conception
that they were more widely accepted than they have
proved to be.</p>

<p class='c004'>These truths remain: (1.) Culture is synonymous with the
repression of brute force; (2.) Nations are oppressed by their
brazen breast-plate, and, if its weight increases, they will be
crushed by it; (3.) Right relations are as possible between nations
as they have gradually been proven to be between individuals,
tribes, boroughs, cities and provinces; (4.) The abolition of war
as a legal institution of human society, when such abolition is
made a matter of principle, will result in undreamed-of increase
of material wealth and moral elevation. All these truths, and
many theories begotten of them, have not lost an iota of their
logical content and of their blessed potentiality from the fact that
foolish humanity, through its most powerful agents, government,
church and press, still emphasizes dogmas opposed to them.</p>

<p class='c004'>The advocates of peace maintain their principles. Not only
so; they do not rest from their labors; they will not allow the results
thus far obtained to slip from their grasp. The institutions
created at The Hague, despite the resistance of bellicose
Powers, are faithfully guarded by those who helped to create
them. The Interparliamentary Union, now in session at Paris,
has assumed the task of popularizing, developing and executing
the Articles of The Hague. Their co-operators in England continue
to protest against the South African war and the subjugation
of the Boers, in spite of the supercilious jingoism of government
and of the hypnosis of the masses. The Social Democrats,
the Ethicists—men of independent tendencies, all of them—lift
up warning voices against the fever of Imperialism in general,
and specifically against the reckless love of adventure which
first scents loot and then seeks revenge in expeditions against a
country with four hundred million peace-loving inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>To save, to save, to avert universal war—that is the purpose
for which the enemies of war will strive untiringly until the very
last moment. If their strength be insufficient, where shall we
place the blame? The fault is not theirs. It rests with the
millions of their contemporaries, who, though at heart they desire
the same result, yet turn away in contempt or apathy from
those who are laboring for it, instead of aiding these labors by
the weight that lies in the consensus of the masses. With those
who ignore, suspect and belittle the work of peace—even in cases
where that work has brought about positive results, where it has
matured practical propositions—instead of co-operating with sincere
workers in their elaborations of these propositions and enforcing
them with opponents—with those must the fault lie.</p>

<p class='c004'>Great changes come to pass slowly, but in times like the present,
when upheavals are fierce and dangers lie near, it might be
hoped that swifter advances should be made in the conflict between
the new and the old. Just as, immediately before the vote
was taken on the Heinze law, a group of devoted men was formed
to oppose that measure, which succeeded in defeating it, so, in
the face of the present conspicuous and overwhelming manifestation
of the principle of brute force, the friends of right might
resolutely band themselves together, and, with shields upraised,
declare a crusade for the liberation of politics from the thraldom
of that immoral tradition.</p>

<p class='c004'>Possibly the hope that such a step could be taken might again
involve an over-estimate of our contemporaries. What matters
it? Kant said: “Man cannot think too highly of man,” and it
is better to have erred in this direction than, by lukewarm doubt,
to have condoned the fault of those here criticised.</p>

<p class='c004'>What we see happening to-day furnishes proof, furnishes wonderfully
objective illustrations and experimental demonstrations,
not against, but in favor of our doctrines.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the first place, let us consider the war in the Transvaal.
True, it broke out immediately after the conference at The Hague,
and in despite of the principles of arbitration and of mediation
there announced, and subscribed to even by England herself. Yet
it was no triumph for the dogma of the necessity of war; it was
rather a triumph for the <em>advocates</em> of war. For our opponents,
in giving voice to the slogan, “The South African war and the
Chinese horrors were the direct result of the conference,” commit—purposely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>without a doubt—the blunder of confusing sequence
in time with sequence of cause and effect. It is the familiar,
senseless, exploded, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Post hoc, ergo propter hoc</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Seeds which lay slumbering in the world’s soil long before the
conference at The Hague sprouted in these two instances. For
all that the conference itself could achieve was not in the nature
of a harvest, but merely a sowing of seed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The newly created institutions are not yet in operation, their
spirit has not yet become incarnate in the flesh and blood of the
nations, of potentates, of the press. And Mr. Chamberlain was
able to accomplish his purpose, in spite of the pleading of Krüger
for arbitration, even unto the last minute. Every intermediation
was refused, and none was honestly and earnestly considered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Several European rulers, who, as their panegyrists maintain,
are soldiers, body and soul, had no desire to restrain the arm of
England; they wished Queen Victoria success and noted the progress
of the war with semi-joyous interest. But with the people of
non-English countries there was pronounced opposition to this
war; there was a manifestation of the very thing whereof we
dream as a foundation of an alliance of European States, namely,
a European conscience. This conscience rose in rebellion against
the fact that a war of conquest should be waged in this our day;
that a great country should seek to subjugate small, free republics.
From every side came protests, petitions, actions of various
sorts, to move the English to call a halt in this war. In England
itself the peace party untiringly made remonstrances in this
direction. The deeply rooted sentiment, “My country, right or
wrong,” had to give way to a sense of justice deeper still, and, as
boldly as Zola and Picquart entered the lists against the General
Staff, even so boldly did noted Englishmen battle against the imperialistic
ministry of their native land. Ten years ago these
things would not have happened. Neither Europe nor America
would have opposed this war so determinedly; still less possibility
would there have been of so powerful a counter-current as arose
in England itself. All these things are symptoms of the new
spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>But, in spite of the sentiment of the nations, the various governments
have refrained from any peace-making intervention;
and in London this attitude has been regarded as the correct
one. But it was correct according to ancient standards only; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>was in direct contravention to the new lines officially marked out
at The Hague.</p>

<p class='c004'>The progress of the war in the Transvaal has shown, forcibly
and terribly, what a false relation the possible advantages of war
bear to its positive disadvantages. Fifty thousand of her youth,
healthy and vigorous youth, has England lost in the past ten
months; sixty-one million pounds sterling of her national wealth
have been wasted; the respect and sympathy of the world have
been recklessly sacrificed; the character of the nation has been
brutalized by the passions aroused, and freedom, the pride of the
British people, freedom of speech, as well as freedom of the individual,
has been imperilled, for even now the spectre of conscription
is raising its head. The fruits of half a century of national
education have been destroyed in this one attack of war-fever.
And in place of the great, submarine Channel-tunnel already
planned, the fortification of Dover has been begun. India
is devastated by a famine, and the money wasted in South Africa
for the destruction of human life might have saved the famished
ones.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the end, the “bitter end,” of this campaign is not yet.
There are no more decisive battles fought nowadays, even where
one side has overwhelming force. There is nothing now save
mutual extermination of the troops in the field, devastation of
the land in which the combat takes place, cessation of commerce,
danger of further complications and the carrying of infectious
diseases into other lands.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reports of Mr. Burdett-Coutts in the House of Commons
in reference to the horrible condition of the sick and wounded in
South Africa are a confirmation of what the advocates of peace
have constantly voiced, namely, that, with our present means of
destruction and our present methods of warfare, sanitation is an
illusion.</p>

<p class='c004'>And then came the news of the insurrection of the Boxers and
the massacres of the missionaries in China. This, too, is the harvest
of seed sown in Europe in these latter years. Apart from the
fact that hatred of strangers is a barbarism, concerning which
we lack the right to grow indignant so long as the story of anti-Semitic
riots and expulsion of foreigners has a place upon European
annals, everything was done by Europeans in China to
arouse a righteous hatred of foreigners there. Dogmas and wares
<span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>have been thrust upon the Chinese; there has been contemptuous
treatment, appropriation of territory, open declarations as to
the partition of China, backed by plans for the building of fleets.
And running side by side with these things, in constant confirmation
of mercenary greed and of militarism, with an inherent,
blind tendency to expansion, the peaceable, non-military Empire
was supplied with guns and cannons from our own factories and
with instructors from our barracks.</p>

<p class='c004'>Well, what matters it? No one cares to bother with the intricately
interwoven network of origins and causes back of it all.
Here were we faced by facts—a country in wild uproar, the government
overthrown or in league with the rebels against foreigners,
the legations bombarded, Ketteler murdered—such facts
require action.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the opponents of the peace movement seem to be in the
right. Surely, it is impossible to quietly look on while such
things are happening; there is no opportunity for arbitration.
What is there left but war? Is not that in some cases the only resource,
the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima ratio</span></i>?” Now, are ye convinced, ye dreamers,
that conditions may at any time arise which will force upon men a
resort to arms? Therefore there must be no cessation of armaments,
no relaxation in the cultivation of a warlike spirit. Confess
that you are beaten, that you have no answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nay, but we do answer. As a well-ordered State maintains a
police force to execute the decrees of its judges, to secure robbers
and maniacs, to overpower mobs that throw stones and apply
torches, to protect those who are persecuted by violence, so would
an alliance of Culture-States, such as we contemplate, require an
armed force to serve international right as an executive power.
Power in the service of the right differs essentially from the power
which pronounces all its decisions and purposes to be right. The
individuals of a community are not as yet so virtuous, so rational,
and so reliable as to render unnecessary every kind of protection
and punishment. It is the same with nations. The nations of the
earth are not as yet so cultured and so peaceable that a union of
nations could exist without a tribunal or an armed force.</p>

<p class='c004'>What has come to pass before our eyes? Spontaneously, without
previous agreement, all nations decided to hurry their ships
and troops to the relief of those whose lives were in danger; to
punish the criminals, to restore order in the convulsed Empire of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>China; to re-establish organized government there. And since
such an enterprise can succeed only when it is undertaken
unanimously, there was suddenly formed a “world army,” a confraternity
of previously antagonistic nations, to battle side by
side in the name of civilization against an outburst of barbarism.
Thus has the impulse of events begun the realization of that
fundamental requirement urged by the advocates of the peace
movement from the very first—unanimity among the Culture-States,
a comradeship of co-operation, a setting aside of conflicting
individual rights in the service of a higher solidarity of interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>This solidarity of interest has now been recognized in the face
of the Chinese danger. We recognized it long ago in the face of
the danger of militarism. The threatened world-war, the ruin
that impended, seemed to us such an abomination of barbarism,
and the prevention of that calamity so imperative a duty of civilization,
that conflicts of interest and all little bickerings and
minor contentions might well be set aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>A campaign carried on with a common mind and for a common
purpose, such as that undertaken in China, would not have
been prevented if it had been preceded by a cessation of further
armaments, as suggested by Russia at The Hague, or even by a
decided reduction of the standing armies. For—let my readers
note carefully this fact—the “Culture-Army,” the police of international
civilization, needs but be composed of a small but representative
section of the various nations. The entire available
force of Europe, America and Japan could not be sent to China at
present, at any rate. When arms are used in the service of right
only, the power of such police, or, instead of police—for the word
has an unpleasant sound—let us say of such a knighthood of culture,
would be overwhelming. For crime—within the limits of a
civilized community this holds true as well—is usually committed
by single individuals or small bands. It is the same among nations.
If questions of common morals arose, whose validity is
recognized as of interest to all, every single disturber of the peace,
every single tyrant, every single land-grabber would be resisted in
the execution of his purpose and would be punished by all. Had
all civilized nations hastened to the aid of the Armenians,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c005'><sup>[1]</sup></a> had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>they all advised Spain to relinquish Cuba, or hindered America in
its desire to subjugate the Philippines; had they all insisted that
England must listen to Krüger’s proposals for arbitration, the
cruelties and conflicts of the latest slaughters of multitudes could
have been avoided. Different nations can advance with united
purpose against a common danger, and they can do so by means
of the very elements that otherwise support and foster antagonism,
namely, by means of their armies. Twice has this been
demonstrated; once not long ago in Crete, and now in China.
The German Kaiser could command the troops he sent to Eastern
Asia to fight shoulder to shoulder with Frenchmen, Russians and
Japanese. And it has been possible to appoint one general for
this international army.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Let it not be objected that a “man’s house is his castle,” and that interference
with internal affairs is excluded with nations as it is with individuals.
Massacres are not internal affairs. If one man throws down another in my neighbor’s house and is preparing to kill him, and the victim’s
cries reach my ears, it is not a breach of the peace if I hasten to help
him or call the police.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The possibility that all Culture-States can enter into an alliance,
though contested by our opponents, has been proven in
fact. Humanity is forced into solidarity by normal evolution
along the lines of natural law. What the force of circumstances
has brought about could have been accomplished by free will and
design, and, so accomplished, it would have been more systematically
done, and would have rested upon more secure foundations.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now, no one has faith in the present casual and transient
coalition, and many prophesy that the Powers will quarrel over
China, and that the long-dreaded world-conflict will arise in consequence.
This, too, is used as an argument against us. “A concert?
Unanimity? The slightest disturbance unhinges it all.
Rivalry is aroused. No one Power is willing to grant the other
a privilege or an advantage. When the coalition campaign has
reached its end, or even before that, conflicting interests will assert
themselves and the European war will be upon us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>True, that war will break out, if there be no forum for the
settlement of chance contentions, a forum which, by common
agreement, would adjust all differences. Everything goes to
prove how necessary such a forum is. The sad fact that it is not
as yet in operation surely does not militate, in the least, against
the possibility or the utility of the establishment of such a tribunal.
The foundation of it was laid at The Hague. That it is
generally ignored demonstrates the fact that militarism struggles
against an institution which would undermine war.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>The question, “How in the world do you propose to prevent
war in the face of the present upheaval in China?” has been thus
answered by Dr. Benjamin F. Trueblood, Corresponding Secretary
of the American Peace Society:</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have been asked how we would have settled the present
trouble in China without war. That is as if one were to ask how
we would prevent a fire when the flames were already bursting from
all the windows. The settlement of the trouble by us without war
would have required, first of all, that it be turned over to us for settlement,
or that the powers involved in it would agree conscientiously
to follow, in their efforts at adjustment, the principles and methods
which we might suggest. The utter impossibility of either of these
contingencies in the case of the trouble with China shows the thoughtlessness
of the question.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The time to have begun the pacific settlement of the difficulty
was many years ago. Given certain conditions, practices and beliefs,
such as have for a long time existed in the relations of the other
countries to China, and war or something like it was inevitable. No
advocate of peace has ever been simple enough to imagine that war
can be avoided when every condition leading to good understanding
and peace has been neglected or trampled under foot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another point steadily maintained by the advocates of peace
and denied by their adversaries has come clearly to light in
these latter days, namely, that wars are instigated and brought
to their culmination by certain influential men without the slightest
reference to the people, to parliaments or to the choicest spirits
of the nations. What has been decided upon by the powers
that be, what has been mapped out by “Cabinets,” is promulgated
as an accomplished fact, approved by the chorus of a servile press,
and, if it can be made sensational, cheered by an enthusiastic
mob. How necessary that every land should have a ministry of
peace, an official organism representing the interests of peace,
under whose protection that portion of public opinion which is
averse to war might make itself heard. How essential an independent,
ethically elevated press, conscious of the duty growing
out of its power, the duty to guide the people in the way of unity,
of conciliation, of a just consideration of both sides of a quarrel—in
short, in the way of peace, the only way worthy of civilization
and culture. The opposite is true. The political press, in a
ponderous majority, is to-day a forge for the heating of the irons
of war.</p>

<p class='c004'>Current events reveal the fact that our system is not being put
in practice, but they reveal no flaws or contradictions in the system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span>itself, for it has none. Without a flaw or contradiction it
harmonizes with the law of evolution. The new age—with its advance
in technical inventions (with especial reference to the possibility
of the slaughter of masses), with its ties of international
solidarity, its reciprocal economic interdependencies, its
sublimated ethical requirements—has outgrown the system of
war, and outgrows it more and more daily. This truth is set
forth, as it were, in an object-lesson in the rush of action upon
the stage of the world’s theatre. On the other hand, take the
war in the Transvaal. What economic losses (to say nothing of
the moral loss) to England and to the rest of the world has it involved;
and the end of the war is not yet in sight, in spite of the
fact that England outnumbers her adversaries ten to one. That
war and the Chinese problem both show that the nations are being
mechanically driven to the position which the advocates of peace
have suggested as the only one that can be taken as a result of the
exercise of free will and rationality, namely, coalition, surrender
of secondary specific interests and contentions for the sake of a
higher common interest, of culture and humanity, and the creation
of a “world army.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The position into which the Powers are mechanically forced,
which in its external form seems to adjust itself to the demands
of the peace idea, is not yet permeated by the <em>spirit</em> of the idea;
not yet based upon the firm groundwork of institutions of peace.
It is filled with militarism, confused with military projects and
national antagonisms.</p>

<p class='c004'>The contrast between war and culture is more definitely set
forth than could be done in volumes of essays and of peace literature
in the addresses and newspaper articles which accompany
the sending forth of the “Army of Humanity.” The emphasis
placed upon the help of God, upon the religion of love and
of tenderness, and the synchronous emphasis placed upon revenge
and threats of horrors, have never been in so glaring a contrast.
A clinging to old ideals of force, reference to the thought that, a
thousand years <em>hence</em>, one member of the human family shall
tremble before another, as men did a thousand years <em>ago</em> under
the lash of Attila; the recommendation on the part of various
journals of methods of retaliation savoring of the wildest of
savagery, the slaughter of masses of men, desecration of sanctuaries
and graves, etc., and all these proposed as a means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>spreading civilization; all this must needs be recognized by the
world at large as strident dissonance.</p>

<p class='c004'>And what has brought the world to this recognition? The
principles of the peace movement. Denied as they are, they have
sunk deep into the conscience of the age. The community of interests
in the world has also had its share in effecting this result.
This has reached such a degree that a change from conditions of
might to conditions of right has become a positive necessity, an
essential of life. What stands revealed in the peace movement is
not the dream of supramundane fancy, but a manifestation of
the instinct of self-preservation in civilization.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
